ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Ray Crescent Garcia

I am a university student from New Zealand currently in my Final Year of studying for my Bachelor's of Computer Science.
I particularly enjoy coding games and am currently learning train AI models and how to use YOLOv4 to detect objects.

I am Proficient in Languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C, C#, Java and Python but hope to improve and learn more.
